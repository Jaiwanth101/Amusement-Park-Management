Project Phase I - Requirements Document

Consider a mini-world of your choice and come up with requirements for database design, and functional requirements for database operations. The criteria for the database requirements to meet are:

1.    At least five entity types, 
2.    at least two weak-entity types, 
3.    at least five relationship types, 
4.    at least one n>3 relationship type, 
5.    at least one subclass, and 
6.    few composite, multi-valued, derived attributes.

There will be a small weight for mini-worlds that are unique with a very specific purpose and specialized applications. For such mini-worlds above requirements can be relaxed. 
The functional requirements to meet are:

1.    At least one loading or insertion of data
2.    At least few modify or update operations
3.    At least one delete operation
4.    At least two reports to be generated
The functional requirements must make at least one change to the data requirements.
